# _map_align_

**!!! UNDER DEVELOPMENT !!!**

_map_align_ takes two contact maps and returns an alignment that attempts to maximize the number of overlapping contacts while minimizing the number of gaps [1].

### Download and Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/gjoni/map_align
cd map_align
make
```

### Usage

```
Options:  -s alignment.a3m               - input, required
          -c contacts.txt                - input, required

          -L list.txt with template IDs  - input, required
          -O prefix for saving top hits  - output, optional
          -N number of top hits to save    10
          -T TM-score cleaning cut-off     0.80
          -M max template size             1000

          -I number of DP iterations       10
          -t number of threads             1

```

##### More details on some options:

* `-M MAX` templates with more than `MAX` residues will be skipped 
 (longer templates could take much more time to be aligned)

* `-T TM` top N partial hits will be cleaned to exclude structurally similar matches: 
 if two hits from the scan stage are similar with TM-score > `TM` then only one 
 (with the higher alignment score) will appear in the final pool

* `-O PREFIX` top models will be saved as `<PREFIX><TEMPLATE_ID>.pdb` and `<PREFIX><TEMPLATE_ID>.ali` where `TEMPLATE_ID` is an ID from the `list` file

##### List of temlates

List of templates is a text file with one entry per line. IDs of the templates are used in output and should not be longer than 10 characters.

```
/path/to/template1.pdb ID1
/path/to/template2.pdb ID2
...
```

##### Contact map format

Contact map is a list of residue-residue pairs in the following format (similar to [CASP RR format](http://www.predictioncenter.org/casp12/index.cgi?page=format#RR)):

```
i  j  d1  d2  p
```

* `i`, `j` - indices of the two residues in contact
* `d1`, `d2` - distance limits defining a contact (currently not used)
* `p` - probability of the contact, should be in the range (0;1]

### Examples

`
cd example
tar xf ecod70.tar.gz
`

Align a contact map to a library of templates (simplest call):
```
$ ../map_align -s T0806.a3m -c T0806.con -L ecod70.list
```

Align a contact map to a library of templates saving top 5 hits at TM-score=70% identity cut-off and running the program on 4 cores:
```
$ ./map_align -s example/T0806.fas -c example/T0806.con -L example/list -N 5 -T 0.70 -t 4 -O example/T0806.
```


### Acknowledgements

This package is a reimplementation of the [original map_align](https://github.com/sokrypton/map_align) program by S.Ovchinnikov [1] to allow for:
 - direct use of PDB files as templates
 - output of partial threads in PDB format
 - cleaning of partial threads based on TM-score [2]
 - multithreading
